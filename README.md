outro.py to run in YOUR computer (in the code that I posted) you NEED: Python 3.9, Selenium, and chromedriver.exe (edit the executable_path line:10 to your chromedriver.exe path,it should be on venv)

outro.exe NEEDS to be on Desktop folder  and you also NEED chromeedriver.exe on the Desktop folder

YOU NEED TO HAVE INSTALLED CHROME VERSION 105.0.5195
